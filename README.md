# Password Generator

## Goal 
The main goal of this project was to create a password generator that randomly generates a password under certain selected criteria.

## What I learned
In this project, I learned how to use window.prompt to notify users with windows. I also learned how to make functions return values.

## Challenges of this assignment
I definitely felt like I did not have enough time to work on this assignment as much as I would like to. I also struggled a lot with understanding how to get started and break down what I had to do in this assignment. With what I currently have, I feel like I only achieved the first and last parts of the acceptance criteria.
